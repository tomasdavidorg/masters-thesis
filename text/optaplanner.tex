In this chapter, the planning engine Optaplanner is presented. OptaPlanner~\cite{OptaPlannerPages, DroolsBook} is
an~open-source project developed by JBoss community since 2006 and it is software designed for solving planning
problems. Optaplanner is a~part of the KIE (Knowledge Is Everything) group project~\cite{Kie, Drools} and it combines
optimization algorithms with the core of rule engine -- Drools Expert~\cite{Drools}.

Section~\ref{PlanningProblemSection} describes what planning problem is and Section~\ref{OptaPlannerTerminologySection}
presents basic terminology. Introduction of basic phases of the OptaPlanner configuration is described in
Section~\ref{PlannerConfSection}.

\section{Planning problem}\label{PlanningProblemSection}
In everyday life, at work or in another occasion, people meet problems for which they have limited resources (time,
money, etc.). Also, organizations need to face these problems at a~larger scale. Planning mechanisms help them to save
these resources and time.

Planning problems can be for example N-Queen problem, Vehicle Routing Problem, Course timetabling or Hospital bed
planning. More examples can be found in~\cite{OptaPlannerDoc}. Following paragraphs presents two of these problems.

\paragraph{N-Queen problem}
One of the planning problems is N-Queen problem. Although it is not very realistic, it is an~ideal example. In this
case, it is necessary to place \texttt{n} queens to the chess field of size \texttt{n}. It is known from the Chess game
that queen can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally. The goal is to achieve that none of the queens should
threaten another.

\paragraph{Vehicle Routing Problem}
The second example of the planning problems is Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)~\cite{VehicleRouting}. Problem consists of
depots, customers and vehicles. Vehicles depart from depots, collect objects of each customer and bring them back to
the depot. Each vehicle can service multiple customers but it has a~limited capacity. The goal is to minimize total
traveled distance. There are several variants of this problem, for example Vehicle Routing Problem with time windows.

\section{OptaPlanner terminology}\label{OptaPlannerTerminologySection}
In OptaPlanner, the planning problem is represented by Java classes, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) configuration file
and optional DRL (Drools Rule Language) files. Java classes together form the model of the planning problem.
Configuration file is written in XML and it serves to describe the configuration of Solver. Configuration contains
links to classes of declared model, score configuration and used optimization algorithm. DRL files which are optional
contain special rules and can be used for calculation of a~score. Otherwise, the score can be calculated by a~Java
function. Important concepts from OptaPlanner terminology are described in the following paragraphs.

\paragraph{Solver}
A~tool in OptaPlanner which solves planning problems is called Solver. It uses the problem model and calculates the
score of possible solutions. Except of calculating the score, Solver uses optimization algorithms to find the best score
of planning problem. End of calculation can be caused for example by finding of the best solution or by reaching of
a~time limit.

\paragraph{Solution}
Solution is an~instance of the problem. There are two basic types of solutions in OptaPlanner -- uninitialized and
initialized solutions. In contrast to second type, the first one does not have the calculated score yet.

\paragraph{Score}
Score is a~way how to compare two solutions of a~problem. Every solution has own score and solution with higher score is
better. There is significant difference between best and optimal solution. Solver always finds solution with the highest
score from possible solutions -- the best solution. Although it is not always the optimal solution which is the best
solution of current problem. There are several techniques for comparing scores:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Score constraint signum} -- based on constraints. Solver finds the highest score for the positive
    constraint and try to reduce a~negative value for the negative constraints.
    \item \textbf{Score constraint weight} -- technique where constraints may not have same weight and thus some of them
    can be more important then others. For example, the first condition is three times more important than the second
    condition.
    \item \textbf{Score level} -- based on levels of score. Some scores are more important than others (Hard scores).
    Therefore, they are compared first and then it can be decided by some of the less important scores (Soft scores).
    \item \textbf{Pareto scoring} -- Score constraints cannot be weighted against each other therefore they are compared
    individually and score with the most dominating score constraints wins.
    \item \textbf{Combining score techniques} -- All the previous techniques can also be combined.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Drools and DRL}
Drools~\cite{Drools} is a~business rules management system which provides way how to use rules, workflow and event
processing. DRL file is one of the methods of storing business rules. OptaPlanner uses Drools as one of the options of
score calculations which are are described in Section~\ref{ScoreConfigSection}.

\paragraph{Optimization algorithms}
Every individual calculation of the solution takes some time. OptaPlanner does not count only with one solution but it
is looking for the best solution and there may be a~lot of solutions. The search space can grow to astronomical
proportions and the calculation time as well. More information about optimization algorithms can be found
in~\cite{OptaPlannerDoc}. Following list shows some of the algorithms that can be used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exhaustive Search} -- Brute Force, Branch And Bound.
    \item \textbf{Construction heuristics} --  First Fit, Weakest Fit,  Strongest Fit, \dots
    \item \textbf{Metaheuristics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Local Search} --  Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, \dots
        \item \textbf{Evolutionary Algorithms} -- Evolutionary Strategies, Genetic Algorithms.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{OptaPlanner configuration}\label{PlannerConfSection}
In this section, OptaPlanner configuration is described. It can be divided into following five basic steps that are
required to get the best solution:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Modeling of planning problem} -- creation of a~class that implements the \texttt{Solution} interface
    and definition of planning domain classes.
    \item \textbf{Solver configuration} -- settings of a~score function, optimization algorithms and other parameters of
    Solver.
    \item \textbf{Loading of problem data set} -- insertion of planning entities and variables instances into Solver.
    \item \textbf{Activation of Solver} -- activation of mechanism for problem solving and automatic calculation of
    scores.
    \item \textbf{Acquiring the best solution} -- invocation of the method which returns the best obtained solution.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modeling of planning problem}
Modeling of planning problem consists of defining individual parts of the problem and creation of corresponding Java
classes for problem fact, planning entity and variable, planning solution and other.

\paragraph{Problem fact}
Problem fact is a~class which contains getters returning its properties. This class does not contain special OptaPlanner
code (it can be ordinary Java class) and during planning it does not change. In case of N-Queen problem, rows and
columns classes are problem facts.

\paragraph{Planning entity}
Planning entity is a~class which change during planning. It has to be marked with \texttt{@PlanningEntity} annotation.
Each planning entity has one or more planning variables. In case of N-Queen problem, Queen class is planning entity
because its row position changes.

\paragraph{Planning variable}
Planning variable is a~property of planning entity class with required getter and setter. In case of N-queen problem,
row property is planning variable. It must be marked with \texttt{@PlanningVariable} annotation which contains
\texttt{valueRangeProviderRefs} property which defines possible values of the planning variable.

\paragraph{Planning value and planning value ranges}
Planning value is a~possible value of a~planning variable. Usually, a~planning value is a~problem fact but it can be any
object, for example a~\texttt{Double}. Planning value range is a~set of possible planning values of planning variable.
This set can be a~countable (for example row 1, 2, 3 or 4) or uncountable (for example any \texttt{Double} between 0.0
and 1.0). Value Range is marked with \texttt{@ValueRangeProvider} annotation which has property \texttt{id} pointing to
\texttt{valueRangeProviderRefs} of \texttt{@PlanningVariable} property. \texttt{@ValueRangeProvider} annotation can be
placed on two types of methods -- on the Solution or on the planning entity. Usually, first type is used.
\texttt{Collection} or \texttt{ValueRange} are two types which can be used as return type of the method.

\paragraph{Planning problem and planning solution}
Each planning problem has to be defined as a~class which is used by the Solver to solve the problem. In the case of
N-Queens problem, class must contains column, row and queen lists. The planning problem corresponds with unresolved
planning solution. The solution must be described by a~class that implements the \texttt{Solution} interface. This
interface requires to implement \texttt{setScore}, \texttt{getScore} and \texttt{getProblemFacts} methods.

\subsection{Solver configuration}\label{ScoreConfigSection}
The second part of OptaPlanner configuration is configuration of Solver. It is described by XML file and it can also be
changed dynamically at runtime using \texttt{SolverConfig} API. Basically, it can be divided into three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Model definition} -- consists of the name of a~class that implements the \texttt{Solution} interface
    and a~name of class that represents the planning entity.
    \item \textbf{Score function definition} -- consists of settings such as a~type of score and a~class which calculate
    the score (or DRL file with a~rules that are used for calculation).
    \item \textbf{Optimization algorithms definition} -- contains settings of algorithms that are used to optimize the
    calculation for obtaining the best score of problem.
\end{enumerate}

Thanks to the score calculation, all of the initialized solution can be evaluated by a~score and these are three
following ways how it can be implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy Java score calculation} -- The calculation is performed using single method of a~class which
    implements the \texttt{EasyScoreCalculator} interface and this method should return score of solution. This simple
    way how to calculate score is slower and less scalable than other methods.
    \item \textbf{Incremental Java score calculation} -- The calculation is performed using several specific methods of
    computation. This is a~quicker approach, but more difficult for implementation. Class which defines this type of
    calculation must implements the \texttt{IncrementalScoreCalculator} interface.
    \item \textbf{Drools score calculation} -- The calculation is performed using DRL rules. They are stored in
    \texttt{.drl} file. More information about rules can be found in~\cite{DroolsBook, Drools}. This approach is well
    optimizable but DRL language must be used.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Loading of problem data set}
Last step before the start is the loading of problem data set into Solver. This is done by uploading planning entities
and planning values to the appropriate collection in a~class that implements the \texttt{Solution} interface. From this
step, everything is ready for Solver activation.

In N-Queen example, all queens and all rows have to be initialized and uploaded to the appropriate collections of
N-Queens solution class.

\subsection{Activation of Solver and acquiring the best solution}
Activation of Solver takes place simply by calling the \texttt{solve()} method of the Solver instance class with the
parameter containing reference to an~instance of a~class that implements the \texttt{Solution} interface.

After the calculation by calling \texttt{getBestSolution()} method of the Solver instance, the best solution is
returned. In the case of N-Queen problem, a~solution where each queen has assigned one row should be obtained and if
optimal solution is found, then no two queens are threaten to each other.

\paragraph{Termination}
Not all calculations terminate automatically and therefore it is sometimes necessary to add conditions which causes the
termination. Subsequent options can stop calculation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time limit termination} -- occurs after exceeding the time limit.
    \item \textbf{Best score termination} -- terminates when a~certain best score is reached.
    \item \textbf{Step count termination} -- occurs after exceeding the limit of step count of calculation.
    \item \textbf{Combining of multiple terminations} -- previous termination methods can also be combined.
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous termination from another thread} -- can be used if it is necessary to terminate
    calculation differently than by automated methods.
\end{itemize}
