In this project, the Java programing laguage and its most common platform Java SE were presented. Java is cross-platform language which is used for application development on Android operation system. Android is largely used as primary system for mobile devices and after its presentation, OptaPlanner tool for solving optimalization problem was described. OptaPlanner is completely written in Java and it was not ported on Android yet. Therefore, this work focus on the portation of this tool and deals with a problems associated with it.

Application Programming Interfaces libraries of Java SE and Android was compared and it was found that they differ significantly. In Android API, 20 packages are completely missing and 9 packages are incomplete out of 38 Java SE API packages. On closer inspection, it was revealed that one of the OptaPlanner tool dependecies is missing in Android API. This missing package is called JavaBeans technology.

For JavaBeans problem was suggested five solution, namely: Repacking java.beans redistribution to java namespace, Use the OpenJDK distribution source code, Use of pruned rt.jar from OpenJDK distribution, Use of OpenBeans in OptaPlanner project and Removing and replacing JavaBeans from OptaPlanner. Comparison of advantages and disadvan-
tages of individual solution was selected solution which does not change source code of Optaplanner tool, has a license that allows easy application and generally is suitable for use on Android.

The proposed solution for further progress is Repacking of java.beans redistribution to java namespace. Next procedure will be portation of OptaPlanner core to Android platform and creating of simple Android application which demonstrate Vehicle Routing Problem on ported tool.
